# Phase-1-wk3-code-challenge

# Description 

Implement a 'mini' web application using JavaScript.

# Introduction

For this assessment, you'll be working on Flatdango.

Flatiron Movie Theater is open for business! You will be building out an
application, Flatdango, that allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the
theater.


# Getting Started 

In order for you to use the content on this repo ensure you have the following:

- A ccomputer that runs on either of the following;(Windows 7+, Linux, Mac OS)
- nodejs 9.0+

# Running the Live Hosted Application Link

To use this link just go above to the about section where you see a link under `FlatDango Movie Booking`

When you press the link the application and features should show:

- The Titles of all the movies listed
- Press one movie and details should show the description, showtime, runtime and available tickets.
- To book the movie you like simply press `buy ticket` on the bottom right of the card. Then you will see the number of available tickets descreasing.
- When the available ticket number becomes 0, it will show you an Alert that says `Tickets Sold Out`
